### What Is and Isn't Allowed: Examples

git-lrc functionality.

**Examples of ALLOWED use:**

- Using git-lrc to review code for your company's projects
- Deploying git-lrc on your company's infrastructure for your development team
- Connecting git-lrc to your private GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repositories
- Modifying git-lrc's configuration or prompts for your team's needs
- Providing consulting services to help other companies set up git-lrc
- Building internal integrations between git-lrc and your other tools

**Examples of NOT ALLOWED use:**

- White-labeling git-lrc and offering it to your customers for money
- Hosting git-lrc and charging people money to access it
- Modifying the software to bypass license tier restrictions or unlock paid features
- Distributing a modified version of git-lrc commercially
- Offering git-lrc as part of a paid development tools bundle

### Definitions

The **"licensor"** is the entity offering these terms, specifically Hexmos Technology LLP, a company
registered in India.

The **"software"** is the software the licensor makes available under these terms, including any portion
of it, documentation, configuration files, and associated materials.

**"You"** (and "your") refers to the individual or entity agreeing to these terms.

**"Your company"** is any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other kind of organization that you work
for, plus all organizations that have control over, are under the control of, or are under common control
with that organization. "Control" means ownership of substantially all the assets of an entity, or the
power to direct its management and policies by vote, contract, or otherwise. Control can be direct or
indirect.

**"Your license"** is the license granted to you for the software under these terms.

**"Use"** means anything you do with the software requiring your license, including but not limited to
copying, modifying, distributing, running, or deploying the software.

**"Internal business purposes"** means use of the software to support your own business operations,
where the software is not itself the product or service being sold to third parties. Internal business
purposes do not include operating the software primarily for the benefit of third parties, except in the
course of providing professional services (such as consulting or implementation assistance) where the
software itself is not sold, resold, sublicensed, or made available as a service to those third parties.

**"Trademark"** means trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, and similar rights.

**"License tier"** means the different levels of software functionality and access rights offered by the
licensor, including but not limited to Community (free), Team, and Enterprise tiers, each with distinct

**"Derivative work"** means any work that is based on or derived from the software, including modifications,
translations, adaptations, or any other form in which the software may be recast, transformed, or adapted.

### Fair-Code

This license follows the [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) model: source-available software that permits
broad use and modification while reserving exclusive commercialization rights to the licensor.

This software is not "open source" as defined by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/),
as open source licenses cannot include limitations on commercial use. However, this license provides many
of the same practical benefits for internal and non-commercial use.
